Imagine the WhatsApp server as a central hub, like a big mailbox, where all messages and calls go through. Each user's devices, like their phone and laptop, are like personal mailboxes connected to this central hub.

Here's how they're related and the logical steps:

1. **Registration**: When you install WhatsApp on your phone and laptop, they both connect to the WhatsApp server and say, "Hey, I'm here! I want to receive messages and calls." The server remembers that your phone and laptop belong to you.

2. **Incoming Message or Call**: When someone sends you a message or call, it's like sending mail to your address. The message or call goes to the WhatsApp server.

3. **Notification**: The WhatsApp server looks at its list of registered devices for you (your phone and laptop) and sends a notification to each one, saying, "Hey, you've got a message or call waiting for you!"

4. **Device Interaction**: Your phone and laptop receive the notifications. They show you an alert, like a notification on your screen, saying, "You have a new message or call on WhatsApp!"

5. **User Response**: You can choose to open the message or answer the call on either your phone or laptop. When you do, that device tells the server, "Okay, I'm handling this message or call now."

6. **Message or Call Handling**: The WhatsApp server helps establish a direct connection between the sender and your chosen device. If it's a call, it rings on your chosen device, and you can talk as usual. If it's a message, it appears in your chat list on that device.

So, in simple terms, the WhatsApp server acts like a middleman, making sure messages and calls get to all your devices, and your devices work together to let you see and respond to them.




Here's a simple diagram to illustrate how registration works at the WhatsApp server side:

This diagram outlines the following steps in the registration process:

1. The WhatsApp Registration Server receives a registration request from a user's device.
2. It checks if the provided phone number is valid and not already registered.
3. If the phone number is valid and not registered, the server generates a verification code (OTP) and sends it to the user.
4. The server waits for the user to input the verification code.
5. Once the user inputs the code, the server verifies if it matches the generated code.
6. If the code matches, the user account is successfully registered.

This simple diagram helps illustrate the high-level flow of the registration process in WhatsApp.

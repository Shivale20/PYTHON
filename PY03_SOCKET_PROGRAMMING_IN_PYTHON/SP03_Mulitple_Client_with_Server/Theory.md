Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Server Side**:
   - **Step 1**: The server sets up a non-blocking socket to listen for incoming connections.
   - **Step 2**: When a client connects, the server accepts the connection and adds the client to a list of active connections.
   - **Step 3**: The server continuously checks for incoming messages from all connected clients using non-blocking I/O operations.
   - **Step 4**: If a message arrives from any client, the server processes it immediately without waiting for other messages. This allows the server to handle multiple clients concurrently.
   - **Step 5**: The server sends outgoing messages to clients in a similar non-blocking manner, ensuring that it can continue processing incoming messages without delays.

2. **Client Side**:
   - **Step 1**: The client establishes a connection to the server using a non-blocking socket.
   - **Step 2**: The client continuously checks for user input and sends messages to the server without blocking the user interface.
   - **Step 3**: If the user types a message, the client immediately sends it to the server.
   - **Step 4**: The client also listens for incoming messages from the server using non-blocking I/O operations.
   - **Step 5**: If a message arrives from the server, the client displays it to the user without waiting for other messages. This allows the user to receive messages from other chat participants while typing or reading messages.

Here's a simplified diagram to illustrate the process:

```
Server Side:                                  Client Side:

  +-----------+                               +-----------+
  |           |     Step 3: Check for          |           |
  |  Non-     |<---------------------------+   |  Non-     |
  | Blocking  |     incoming messages         | Blocking  |
  |  Socket   |                               |  Socket   |
  +-----------+                               +-----------+
       |                                              |
       |                                              |
       +----------------------------------------------+
       |                   Step 4                     |
       |        Process incoming messages            |
       |                from clients                  |
       +----------------------------------------------+
       |                   Step 5                     |
       |        Send outgoing messages                |
       |                 to clients                   |
       +----------------------------------------------+

```

This diagram shows how the server continuously checks for incoming messages from clients and processes them without blocking. Similarly, the client side continuously checks for user input and incoming messages from the server, allowing smooth interaction between the user and the chat application.
